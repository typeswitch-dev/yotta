\ Welcome to yotta! Yotta is a minimalistic forth-like language
\ that has three primitives:
\
\   $XX         Compile the byte XX (in hex).
\   ^XX         Compile code that compiles the byte XX (in hex).
\   : A         Define the word A
\
\ Once a word is defined, it can be invoked by name. All definitions are
\ executed immediately (i.e. all words are "immediate"). As a result,
\ most words will compile something when executed. Words will either emit
\ machine code directly (using ^XX), or they will use "CALL>" to emit a
\ call instruction, or "INLINE>" to inline the rest of the word.
\
\ To program in yotta, we could do everything in machine code, but it would
\ be very hard to read. Our first order of business will be to build up an
\ assembler for x86-64 machine code. This will introduce a number of words
\ that mimic assembler syntax. For example,
\       MOVQ< RAX, RCX
\ will emit the appropriate (MOV RAX, RCX) instruction, and it looks like
\ the expression, but there's actually three words being executed here,
\ "MOVQ<", "RAX," and "RCX". Other than the caret ^XX and dollar $XX
\ notations, yotta does not have syntax, so the punctuation is part of the
\ word.
\
\ We're going to introduce a number of words that are only useful for
\ assembling x86-64 instructions, so we'll place them in a separate
\ ASSEMBLER wordlist. So actually our zero-th order of business is to
\ define a few words that control which wordlist we're creating new
\ words in. Unfortunately we have to write these directly in machine code.

\ User field offsets. Keep this in sync with "struc USER" in the ASM source.
\ These are memory offsets from RBP, for various fields that the engine
\ manages. RBP points to the "user area" and also to a big chunk of R/W
\ memory initially.

\ Dict field offsets. Keep in sync with "struc DICT" in the ASM source.
\ The dictionary is a linked list of definitions.
: $DICT.LINK ^00 ; \ Link to previous dictionary entry.
: $DICT.NAME ^08 ; \ Length byte + 31 bytes of name data, padded with spaces.
: $DICT.CODE ^28 ; \ Pointer to code that will get executed when word is read.
: $DICT.DATA ^30 ; \ Extra data associated with the word.

: CALL> ( -- )
    \ Exit the current word, and compile a call to the rest
    \ of the word. The typical usage is at the start of a word
    \ definition, to turn the whole definition into a word that
    \ simply compiles a call to itself. For example,
    \
    \   : SQUARE CALL> DUP * ;
    \
    \ will make it so that when SQUARE is interpreted, it will
    \ compile a call into its body (the DUP * part). Thus CALL>
    \ is like the default compilation action of most forths.
    \ Using CALL> in the assembler saves us about 3KB so it's
    \ worth it to define this directly in machine code before
    \ we have the assembler up and running.
